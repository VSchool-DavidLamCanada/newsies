            <p>Have you dreamt of not having to wear eyeglasses or contacts again?</p>
            <p>Dr. John Doe mentions that he and his colleagues has been researching for the past 
                4 years and have found a way to fix your vision.</p>
            <p>"We have been analyzing the DNA of many types of animal species. In our study we found that 
                the reason noctural animals eye sight are superior is because they are constantly exposed to light 
                rays in the dark." says Guru Loren one of the animal behaviour and genetic scientists. </p>
            <p>"To prove our theory we conducted lights ray test using lab rats, monkey species and other species who 
                have human like traits. We found the light ray amounts is equivalent to watching tv in the dark." says 
                physicist Neo Darke
            <p> "Eventually we conduct our test on willing individuals who were instructed to watch tv in the dark 
                for a span of 4 month." says Dr. John Doe</p> 
            <p>"One of my patients partcipated in the study. I measures their eyes before and after the study and 
                found my patients vision signicantly improved." says eye doctor Dr. Hugo Glass</p>
