### Instructions

You are going to recreate the front page of a newspaper using block, inline and inline-block elements.

Your newspaper should have:

    A header with the name of your newspaper
    A title for the front page article
    A body with a story.
    
    Several words in the body should be individually styled 
    using inline elements. (i.e. highlighting, bolding, or text-color change)

Come up with your own story. It can be anything, including satire or the recreation of an existing article
somewhere. Make sure it looks nice so that someone could obviously tell it's suppose to be a newspaper.


Extra Credit:

Add a "Classifieds" section to your the newspaper. Title at top (block), classifieds cards with borders 
(inline-block), some of them could have images, whatever else you want to add. Here's an
